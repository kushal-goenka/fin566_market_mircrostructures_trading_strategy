/**
 * InhomogenousOperatorBase is the base class  for Strategy Studio's collection of inhomogenous
 * time series operators
 *
 * Inhomogenious time series operators are designed to efficiently update transformations of time series data
 * where the value of the transformation depends on the time interval between each update, and where the calculation
 * needs to be performed quickly without large memory or computational burdens. These transformations include things like
 * various averaging techniques, and quick calculations of intraday volatility.
 *
 * These implementations are based on the convolution operators described in Dacorogna et al's 'An Introduction to High-Frequency Finance,'
 * which can be referenced for the rationale and math details behind these classes.
