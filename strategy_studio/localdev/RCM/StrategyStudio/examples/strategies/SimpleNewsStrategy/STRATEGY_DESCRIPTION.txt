SimpleNewsStrategy is a sample strategy for trading off of Selerity's corporate news events.

It requires access to Selerity's data feed to run. The strategy takes parameters a financial measure, 
such as earnings per share ("FIN.EPS"), the expected value of the measure, the standard deviation of the 
estimate, and the number of standard deviations (z-score) the actual release must be from normal before entering a 
trade. If the actual news number is above this threshold it will buy and hold for a prespecified time interval 
(specified in seconds), or sell if the number is below the threshold.
