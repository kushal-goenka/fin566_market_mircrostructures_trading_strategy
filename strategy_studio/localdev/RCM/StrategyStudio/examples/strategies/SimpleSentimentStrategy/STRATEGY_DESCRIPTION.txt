SimpleSentimentStrategy is a sample strategy for trading off of Social Market Analytics's sentiment data.

It requires access to SMA's data feed or historical data to run. The strategy takes a list of symbols, and looks to establish long or short positions
based on the depth and strength of the social sentiment data, exposing thresholds for minimum volume and buzz in the sentiment data.

The strategy also contains examples for using bounds constraints on parameter values, and for how to leverage build-in order stats tracking to assist 
order management logic. It also has a simple example for how to implement an optional 'liquidate before the close' behavior.
