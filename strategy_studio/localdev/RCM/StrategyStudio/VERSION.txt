6/11/2019: Version 3.0.0.0 Release Notes

LANGUAGE SUPPORT: Migrates to C++11. Linux builds now specify -std=c++11

ENVIRONMENTS: Adds builds targeting Ubuntu LTS 16.04 and 18.04, deprecates support for LTS 14.04

API REVISION: Migrates root namespace from "LimeBrokerage" to "RCM"

API REVISION: Several Order Book API Enhancements, Refinements, and Performance Optimizations

    IAggrOrderBook price level accessors now return const IAggrPriceLevel*, differentiated from the const IPriceLevel* found in the IOrderBook. The price level interfaces have been differentiated to focus on relevant functionality

    IAggrPriceLevel's participating_markets is now a reference to a map instead of a pointer to a set. The map contains a pair<MarketCenterID, IBookEntry*> to make it simpler to access the size at each participating market. The IBookEntry may be cast to an IPriceLevel if the contributing feed is an order book feed, or a QuoteSide when a BBO quote feed is contributing.

    IPriceLevel has new accessors to differentiate direct_size() vs implied_size() for markets with implied liquidity

    IOrderBook/IAggrOrderBook's BestAskEntry/BestBidEntry accessors have been renamed BestAskLevel/BestBidLevel for better naming consistency

    Added functions FindBidLevel/FindAskLevel/WorstAskLevel/WorstBidLevel to IOrderBook/IAggrOrderBook

    IOrderBook/IAggrOrderBook's GetBuyPriceLevelEnumerator/GetSellPriceLevelEnumerator replaced with simpler intrusive style iteration:

        IPriceLevel/IAggrPriceLevel have next()/previous() accessors to navigate to/from the next best price level pointer

    IPriceLevel's GetOrderEnumerator replaced with simpler intrusive style iteration:

        IPriceLevel has new back()/front() accessors to retrieve order at back or front of price level list. From an IBookOrder retrieved from these functions or from IOrderBook's FindOrderByID, new next()/previous() accessors may be used to navigate to the next/previous order in the price level list.

    DepthUpdate and IBookOrder have a new priority_indicator() field for depth-by-order feeds that give an order priority hint, such as CME MBO. Order book logic will use this indicator when deciding whether to move IBookOrders to end of price level list on an update

    DepthUpdate adds field old_size and will always populate this field along with old_price on an order update. old_size will also be populated for price level updates. This facilitates easier tracking of order book size deltas. For feeds that contain priority_indicator, we also populate old_priority_indicator on an order update.

    DepthUpdate reason() will now never return UNATTRIBUTED_CHANGE or UNKNOWN; if not supplied by the feed source we will make the most reasonable classification based on available information. DepthReasonForChange documentation has been updated to reflect this convention

    DepthUpdates for implied liquidity will be transmitted using update_type() == DEPTH_UPDATE_TYPE_BY_PRICE, rather than by BY_ORDER. Implied price level updates may exist in parallel with either BY_PRICE or BY_ORDER direct updates.

    Cleaned most inaccessible non-const methods from order book interfaces

API REVISION: Bars and trade_stats use quiet_NaN instead of 0.0 for uninitialized values, to disambiguate for instruments that can have 0 or negative prices

	Eliminated deprecated member broker_specific_tags
	Changed closure member type from void* to boost::any
	Added serialization and recovery for boost::any members closure and custom_params if the contained types are std::string and std::pair<int, string>, respectively

ENHANCEMENT: Adds ability to route orders to multiple execution handlers within a single server

	Production servers can load multiple execution handlers by passing a comma delimited list to EXECUTION_HANDLER_MODE
	Strategy Studio accounts are tied to an execution handler which can be configured from Strategy Manager's Admin -> Manage Accounts dialog
	Upon upgrading to v2.10, all accounts will be mapped to the first execution handler in EXECUTION_HANDLER_MODE
	By default, orders will be routed to the handler associated with the instance's configured account
	A new overload of trade_actions()->SendNewOrder now takes an account string which can produce alternate order routing
	Strategy Manager's Order Entry dialog allows an order's account to be specified under Additional Properties

ENHANCEMENT: In LimeAdapter, adds automatic failover on source disconnect

	To enable, set LIME_ADAPTER_ENABLE_AUTO_FAILOVER=true in main server config file
	When enabled, a source disconnect will cause an automatic failover to the next configured ServerGroup
	LIME_ADAPTER_LOGIN_RECONNECT no longer has any effect

EXECUTION HANDLER RENAMING: Renames LimeInsideExecutionHandler to LimeCPPExecutionHandler

	Config file renamed from lime_inside_execution.config to lime_cpp_execution.config

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/24/2014: Version 2.0.0.0 Release Notes

MAJOR STRATEGY MANAGER RELEASE: New version of Strategy Manager, featuring several enhancements:								
								
	Strategy data panels are now all dockable/floatable, with layout memory between runs of the GUI							
	All data grids support flexible filtering, sorting, grouping; copy-paste to excel							
	Strategy Tree now has a search bar							
	Right click from Strategy Grid to navigate to node in Strategy Tree							
	New Params grid added to the Strategy Grid dialog. This is for batch spreadsheet style editing/viewing of params by strategy type.						
	GUI display timezone can be configured via Tools->System Settings							
	Working order count added to summary report and as a column in strategy grid view							
	Orders grid timeout can be set to 'Immediate'. 'N Minutes' is now interpreted as 'periodically find and remove orders that expired more than N minutes ago'							
	Tools->System Settings adds setting for a maximum number of log messages to keep in the GUI							
	Improved CPU and memory utilization under heavier loads							
								
NEW FEATURE: Added ability to mix-and-match quotes and order books as contributor to the aggregate_order_book, with configurable (per MarketCenterID) preferred quote and trade sources								
								
	Allows more customizable behaviour when server subscribes to both consolidated feeds and some depth or  direct-BBO/trade feeds.							
	PREFERRED_QUOTE_SOURCE determines what type of feed should contribute to the aggregate_order_book and top_quote							
	PREFERRED_TRADE_SOURCE determines what type of feed should be used to update bars,  instrument.last_trade() and instrument.trade_stats()							
	By default, server will now use the best available feed type per market center as the preferred source, based on adapter configuration							
	Users can override these defaults by populating a "preferred_feeds.csv" file							
		Format is MARKET_CENTER_ID,PREFERRED_QUOTE_SOURCE,PREFERRED_TRADE_SOURCE						
		Valid source type specifiers are: BEST, CONSOLIDATED, DIRECT, DEPTH, NONE						
		Example entry for subscribers to NYSE OpenBook Ultra (Depth), and NYSE Trades (Direct trades):						
			NYSE,DEPTH,DIRECT					
	In the event of a live data problem with the active preferred feed type, server supports hot swapping a different feed type via command line:							
		set_preferred_feed_type <market_center> <quote_feed_type> <trade_feed_type>						
		For live configuration changes, supported values are DEPTH,DIRECT,CONSOLIDATED,NONE						
	Strategies can check programmatically  the current contributor to the aggregate_order_book by checking for example							
		instrument->markets()[MARKET_CENTER_ID_NYSE].preferred_quote_source()						
								
	Removes older functions instrument->markets().AggrQuote* that seperately tracked aggregated L1 BBO quote volumes for consolidated-only configurations							
								
	Deprecates USE_DEPTH_QUERY config file variable formerly used by some backtest readers							
								
NEW FEATURE: Adds instrument state tracking for daily trade statistics								
								
	instrument->trade_stats() exposes accessors for prior day's close (& close date), most recent open price, day's volume, day high and low.							
	Server endeavors to initialize these stats upon connecting to a live data source, though our ability to do this robustly can vary by data adapter							
	Server increments/updates high,low,volume from the incoming trade ticks of the PREFERRED_TRADE_SOURCE							
	Server updates open/close based on the trade tick's trade conditions; these stats will usually only be available from US Consolidated data feeds							
								
API REVISION: Portfolio tracker's GetRecord() function now returns an IPositionRecord* instead of PositionRecordBase*, exposing a cleaner interface								
								
ENHANCEMENT: Adds config option to have FillSimulator process MOO/LOO/MOC/LOC based on official auction cross prints rather than first trade after open and last trade before close								
								
	To enable, set USE_TRADE_COND_FOR_AUCTION_SIM=true in server's config file							
		This is only recommended for clients who subscribe to SIAC+UTP						
		If tick data source doesnt provide sufficient trade conditions to identify the open/close crosses, auction orders will remain open until end of day						
								
ENHANCEMENT: In ActivAdapter, added support for automatic resubscription after a connection break								
								
	To enable, set ACTIV_RESUBSCRIBE_ON_RECONNECT=true in server config file		

ENHANCEMENT: Updates to version 2.2.0 of Citrius in LimeAdapter											

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/04/2014: Version 1.10.0.0 Release Notes		

ENHANCEMENT: Reduced memory consumption for Back Test servers		
		
	Fill simulator and strategy result store flush data more frequently	
	New optional configuration variable to limit the scope of OrderTracker's memory	
		New setting in main server configuration file that disables tracking of completed orders. If DELETE_COMPLETED_ORDERS=true, orders will be untracked and deleted after the call to OnOrderUpdate if msg.completes_order() returns true. 
		Not recommended for Production servers. Default is false, in which case orders().tracked_orders will rememer all completed orders for the current trading day, as before.
		
ENHANCEMENT: Added server config variables to control threshold for log file output for the Processor and Network loggers.		
	PROCESSOR_LOG_LEVEL and NETWORK_LOG_LEVEL both now default to LogLevel INFO. Accepted values for these settings are: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL	
		
ENHANCEMENT: Streamlined internal serialization for execution handler with RECOVERY_MODE enabled, deprecating the server's execution_handler_pstore files.		
		
API REVISION: Added several MarketCenterID enums for a few FX data sources/venues: FX_ALL, LMAX, OTC		
		
BUG FIX:	Fixed a couple strategy command line bugs introduced in v1.9's revisions: A case sensitivity issue in the start|... command, and a documentation typo in the help output for start_backtest	

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/14/2014: Version 1.9.1.0 Release Notes							
							
BUG FIX: Backtest servers weren't releasing all log file handles at end of experiments

NEW FEATURE: Added ability to configure server's default PREOPEN/OPEN/CLOSE timestamps			
			
	Server's main config file allows the following variables to be set to control when Strategy's OnMarketState fires by default:		
		PRE_OPEN_MARKET_TIME=4:00	
		OPEN_MARKET_TIME=9:30	
		CLOSE_MARKET_TIME=16:00	
			
	Times are interpreted as being in EST time zone by default. This may be changed by one of two new config file options:		
		TIME_ZONE=PST-8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0	
			This must be specified in POSIX time zone format
			
		-or-	
		
		TIME_ZONE_REGION=America/Los_Angeles	
			The value must be a region ID from a boost::date_time timezone database file, an example of which has been added to SDK's docs folder
		TIME_ZONE_DB_FILE=path	
			Specifies location of the boost timezone database file, defaults to ./date_time_zonespec.csv
			
	Changing OPEN_MARKET_TIME will also flow through to Time Bar's default alignment time.		
			
NEW FEATURE: Added ability to manually specify alignment time for TimeBars in RegisterForBars			
	As before, when not specified, default alignment time is current day's open time		
			
NEW FEATURE: Added new bar type, BAR_TYPE_RANGE			
	Similar to VARIANCE bar, but triggers off the high-low interval size of the trade prices in the bar		
	When price gaps, high-low = multiplier*interval size +  remainder, and any remainder from a gap will carry forward to adjust the next period's high or low		
			
ENHANCEMENT: Added ability to filter AdjustedContracts when using eventRegister->RegisterForOptions()			
			
ENHANCEMENT: Improved handling for US Option mini contracts in absence of reference data			
	If Strategy Studio doesn't have access to reference data, it looks for option roots that end in '7' and changes default units and multiplier to 10		
	In LimeReferenceDBPopulator, adds same rule to imported reference database entries, to compensate for multiplier/units not being available from Citrius		
			
API REVISION: Expanded MarketCenterID enum for newer options exchanges, equity ATS's and select initial international markets			
	Also updated TradeCondition enum for US consolidated equity feed ODD_LOT and CORRECTED_CONSOLIDATED_CLOSE sale conditions, and LSE trade types

ENHANCEMENT:  Improved Fill Simulator handling for MOO/LOO auction orders								
								
	These orders now process based first trade for each instrument after the 9:30 EST, rather than at 9:30 EST based on last trade price							
	This resolves backtesting issues handling MOO/LOO orders in tickers that have no pre-open activitey							

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/07/2013: Version 1.5.0.0 Release Notes		

ENHANCEMENT:		Improvements to Citrius LimeAdapter				
						
	Adds support for Citrius' TradesOnly and TopOfBook features					
		Updated format for lime_source_config.txt file is:				
		#FORMAT SHOULD BE: "HOST:PORT,SOURCE_ID,USER,PASSWORD[,TOP_OF_BOOK=false,TRADES_ONLY=false]"				
						
		TOP_OF_BOOK applies to order book feeds and will strip the feed into a single order book entry, containing the aggregated top of book volume, for each side of the market				
						
		For the case where TRADES_ONLY is enabled for all feeds, we've added a new server config variable to enable trades-only simulation on a live server (the same logic as used for a Trades-Only backtest):				
			TRADES_ONLY_SIM=TRUE			
			This parameter must be added to LiveSimServer's config.txt to simulate from just trades data			
						
	Adds handling for new ARCB and NYSB BBO data sources					
		Due to recent depth-feed price increases, we've added special handling for ARCB/NYSB so if you subscribe to both NYOU+NYSB or ARCA+ARCB, the order book				
		feed will populate the instrument's order_book object and the BBO feed will trigger OnQuote with IsDirect=true (the original handling for the deprecated 'NYSE' BBO source), but now if you only subscribe				
		to ARCB or NYSB the adapter treats it as an order book feed and use it to populate the book with a single entry per side. This lets you use ARCB/NYSB as a better drop in replacement for the depth feeds in our API.				
						
	For AMOU Imbalance messages, adjusts feed specific imbalance field normalization					
						
	Adds a cutoff to only log up to 5 instances of Citrius's unknownMsgType error code per data source, to avoid saturating logs with these generally benign error messages					
						
ENHANCEMENT:		Serialization improvements, most notably to LiveSimServer and Production servers' strategy Result File generation				
						
	Result files for live servers are now archived at server shutdown rather than at market close					
						
	If RECOVERY_MODE is on, by default we now append to a single result file (until a strategy Reset is requested), rather than generating a result file per day.					
		A new server config variable "SPLIT_RESULTS_DAILY" can be added to the server config file to elect a results file per day				
						
ENHANCEMENT: 		New server config file variable DISABLE_COMMAND_LINE can be used to disable the server process's command prompt				
						
	With this flag enabled, the server can be run as a background process in Linux.		
	To shutdown the server gracefully, send a signal (eg Cntrl-C), or use CactusServerCmd utility to issue the 'quit' command in file mode or in single command mode.
	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/25/2013: Version 1.4.5.0 Release Notes			
						
BUG FIX: 	Fixes thread safety bug in Fill Simulator that could cause problems if NUM_PROCESSORS config variablewas set higher than 1					
						
NEW FEATURE: Strategy Manager has a new 'Read Only' safety mode, toggled via the 'View' menu, which can be used to disable all features which can affect the behaviour of running Strategies						
						
ENHANCEMENT:		All GUI DateTime data grid columns are now backed by a sequenced data type, so resorting by time preserves order when timestamps are tied				
						
ENHANCEMENT:		DayPnl conventions made more consistent between API and StrategyManager and between backtest and live servers				
						
	Like the Strategy Manager, server's day_pnl() accessors now cache the 4pm EST closing PnL, but don't use that pnl to reset the DayPnL until the day boundry passes					
		Server uses the 4pm closing PnL as its benchmark pnl for the next day whenever possible; if the server shuts down before 4pm, it will use the pnl at shutdown time instead				
						
	With RECOVERY_MODE enabled, live server flavors now send the full history of daily pnl's to the Strategy Manager, available for export in 'Export Daily Performance'					
						
ENHANCEMENT: 		Improved coverage for logging adapter related errors to the Strategy Manager rather than just to log files				
						
ENHANCEMENT:		Improved enforcement of Strategy::OnParamValidate, with a few related minor adjustments to the params API				
						
	OnParamValidate and OnParamChanged are now checked/called when the parameter's default value is set within CactusParams::CreateParam()					
		As a result, we revised the default implementation of OnParamValidate to simply return true in Strategy.h; user implementations should not check whether the param 				
		is already in the cactus_params() collection, as this will not be true yet during parameter creation.				
						
		If a parameter's default value is inconsistent with OnParamValidate (or for numeric params, inconsistent with min/max constraints) CreateParam will return null				
		and errors will be logged to the log file and to the Strategy Manager				

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/28/2013: Version 1.4.0.0 Release Notes	

BUG FIX: 	Fixes issue introduced in v1.3 where in Live Simulation, simulator can improperly reject DAY orders if server starts pre-open without any strategy instances defined						
							
API Revision: IOrderTracker's find() and find_working() accessors now return a const Order* rather than an Order*							
							
NEW FEATURE: New Strategy Grid Viewer available in the Strategy Manager							
	Supplements the Strategy Tree, providing a sortable grid view of all Strategy Instances, along with core metrics: STATE, PnL, DayPnL, SharesTraded						
	Allows multi-select to batch Start/Stop/Pause/Terminate strategies						
							
NEW FEATURE: New custom strategy graph capability							
							
	Adds ability to generate custom time series graphs from within a strategy and display them in the Strategy Manager						
							
	API interfaces are located in IStrategyGraphs.h, IGraphSeriesCollection.h, and IGraphSeries.h						
		API's Strategy class now has a hook DefineStrategyGraphs for an ideal place to add strategy graph series using graphs().series().add("ExampleSeriesName") 					
		Add datapoints to a graph series using graphs().series()["ExampleSeriesName"]->push_back(msg.event_time(), double)					
		By default, server throttles the new points to avoid overloading the network and Strategy Manager with data					
			Minimimum time between points defaults to 1 second for a live server and 15 seconds for a backtest server, may be configured using CUSTOM_GRAPH_THROTTLING_SEC in server config file				
							
	Custom strategy graphs can be viewed in Strategy Manager by opening a copy of the View -> Custom Strategy Graphs dialog and adding the desired series to the selected series list						

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/6/2013: Version 1.3.5.0 Release Notes		

BUG FIX: 	Resolves several issues related to v1.3 enhancements, including:				
	Changes to server default setting for new sales_fee_per_share setting were not registering properly when sent via Strategy Manager's Tools>'Server Default Account Fees' dialog				
	With new WaitToFillIfLockedCrossed simulator option enabled, simulated orders could get stuck REPLACE_PENDING until filled or expired if two replaces were rapidly sent while the market remained in a locked/crossed state				
	ThomsonQA corporate action adapter wasn't fully propogating spinoffs				
					
BUG FIX:	Fixes issue where SendMessageToStrategy, if triggered from a ScheduledEvent at startup with fireIfPast set to true, or from StrategyControl when strategy state moves to STATE_READY, could hang some server versions				
					
ENHANCEMENT: Performance improvement in the SendMessageToStrategy path 					
					
ENHANCEMENT: Several performance improvements in Strategy Manager, most notably in the data grids and when resetting strategy data					
					
ENHANCEMENT: Usablility improvements to Order Entry dialog in the Strategy Manager					
	Order grid right click context menu is less cluttered, as field selector is now limited to column header row.				
	When bringing up 'Replace Order'  via right clicking in Orders grid, original quantity auto populates in the ticket				
	New Order entry dialog sorts strategies alphabetically and preserves TIF and TYPE through changes in MarketCenter field				
					
SDK BUILD MIGRATION: Ubuntu build of the server has been migrated to Ubuntu 12.04 and gcc 4.6.3									

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/16/2013: Version 1.3.0.0 Release Notes										
	
BUG FIX: 	Eliminated a problem where under certain circumstances, fill simulator was sending unnecessary order 'open' updates.									
										
NEW ADAPTER: An equities corporate action adapter is now available for Thomson's QADirect database										
										
NEW FEATURE: New server command line instruction "export_cra_file" available to export orders, fills, and intraday pnl snapshots to csv from a strategy result file										
										
NEW FEATURE: Added a command in StrategyManager to "Reset" a LiveSim or Production strategy instance to its initial state.										
	This will trigger essentially the same code path used between runs of a backtest, ie OnResetStrategyState will trigger in your strategy code									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Several improvements to the Fill Simulator										
										
	Three new simulator settings are available:									
		- Liquidity Multiplier can be used to adjust simulator's liquidity assumptions; higher values make passive limit orders harder to fill and marketable orders easier to fill								
		- Ignore Trade Ticks can be used for full market data simulations to stop trade ticks from generating fills or decrementing the liquidity queue. 								
			Makes passive orders effectively fill only if opposing side of the market crosses the limit price							
		-Wait To Fill If Locked/Crossed can be used to postpone order processing if market data is locked or crossed. Applies to both income orders and resting limit orders.								
			Makes it harder to simulate profits from trading crossed markets which are likely hard to fill against in live trading							
										
	Fill Simulator now has stylized support for MOO/LOO/MOC/LOC orders									
		- Simulator accepts ORDER_TIF_OPG prior to the open and ORDER_TIF_AT_THE_CLOSE prior to the close for NYSE, ARCA, NASDAQ, and BATS; rejects otherwise								
		- For now fill price will be based off the last trade price prior to the market state transition, and we will not validate symbol eligibility or exchange specific rules on side vs imbalance direction as the cross nears								
										
	Stricter TIF handling -- ORDER_TIF_DAY orders will now be rejected after the close for equities and options									
										
	For better consistency with production trading, the Simulator will now Reject rather than return send failures for orders that fail basic parameter validation (eg positive order quantity)									
										
ENHANCEMENT: OneTick backtest reader will now pull and process imbalance ticks from the Citrius tables										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Enforcement of strategy instance name uniqueness is no longer inclusive of terminated strategy instances										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Added a fee setting for sales fees per contract, which can be used to input a setting for FINRA TAF fees.										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Added gross notional as an option to Strategy Manager's intraday graphs										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Improved exception handling in OnParamChanged to catch and report exceptions at a per-parameter level										
										
ENHANCEMENT: In backtest servers, added a filter to SendMessageToStrategy and Topic messaging to prevent strategies from sending messages to instances running in different experiments										
										
ENHANCEMENT: StrategyManager's strategy tree is now sorted alphabetically rather than by instance creation time										
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/12/2012: Version 1.2.0.0 Release Notes										
											
BUG FIX: 	With orders grid timeout enabled, Strategy Manager's order count on the summary report was displaying just the number of orders in the orders grid, forgetting about orders that had timed out of the grid										
											
MAJOR INTERFACE REVISION: Streamlined and enhanced IOrderTracker, and replaced OrderDetails/OrderInfo struct with the Order class; see GettingStarted guide for additional documentation											
											
	IOrderTracker now allows you to look up all tracked orders (any order placed during the trading day) as well as the orders currently working										
											
	Iterating through working orders by instrument is now more efficient										
											
	More extensive set of order stats, including working notional exposures, at both the instrument and strategy level are available through orders().stats() and orders().stats(const Instrument* instr)										
											
		KEY DEPRECATED IOrderTracker FUNCTIONS																		KEY NEW IOrderTracker FUNCTIONS
											
		bool GetRefTrackedOrder(const OrderID orderID, OrderInfo*& detailsPtr)										Order* find(OrderID orderID)
																													Order* find_working(OrderID orderID)
											
		void FetchWorkingOrdersByInstrument(const Instrument* instr, std::vector<const OrderInfo*>* out)			WorkingOrdersConstIter working_orders_begin(const Instrument* instrument)
																													WorkingOrdersConstIter working_orders_end(const Instrument* instrument)
											
		int NumNetWorkingPosition(const Instrument* instrument)														int stats(instrument).net_working_order_size()
											
	The Order class has mostly the same set of information as OrderDetails did, but with class accessors instead of struct members. OrderParams are also directly available as an accessor from this class										
											
	One important change is we're now explicetly separating order_state( ) from last_update_type(); the former gives the overall state of the order (with well defined state transition rules), the latter gives the current order update type.										
	Documentation on the conventions used by OrderState and OrderUpdateType are laid out in the Getting Started guide.										
											
	OrderUpdateEventMsg's fill() accessor now returns a pointer, null when !fill_occured()										
											
	For better consistency with sign conventions on order exposure sizes, fill sizes, portfolio positions and weights, we've updated the sign convention on IPortfolioTracker.short_notional(..) and PositionRecord.short_notional()										
	so they now return negative numbers										
											
	Finally, enums for OrderType and OrderTIF have been updated to allign better to more recent versions of FIX, facilitating support for market on open/close with the Lime execution adapters.										
											
MAJOR INTERFACE REVISION: Streamlined event registration interface; see StrategyEventRegister.h and StrategyRuntimeEventRegister.h for full details, along with example strategies for usage											
											
	Much simpler syntax for event registration. Some examples:										
		eventRegister->RegisterForBars("IBM", BAR_TYPE_TIME, 10);									
		eventRegister->RegisterForMarketData("DELL");									
											
	Registration interface has friendlier naming conventions now (example: typedef RegisterMDEventRetValue is now named EventInstrumentPair)										
											
	In conjunction with the refactored registration interface, we made a few minor naming improvements:										
		BAR_TYPE_RVAR is now BAR_TYPE_VARIANCE									
		BarEventMsg::bar_event_type() -> BarEventMsg::type() ; the message also now has an accessor for p_value() for variance bars									
		ScheduledEventMessage::scheduled_evt_name() -> ScheduledEventMessage::scheduled_event_name()									
											
LIBRARY STRUCTURE REVISION: Renamed "NDLib" to "CactusUtils"											
											
LIBRARY STRUCTURE REVISION: In Linux SDK, removed "lib" prefix from library names for consistency with windows SDK											
											
SDK ORGANIZATION REVISION: Renamed CactusTraderGUI.exe to CactusStrategyManager.exe											
											
NEW FEATURE: Basic order entry now included in the Strategy Manager GUI											
	Located in the Trading->Order Entry dialog. Currently supports most DMA order params, sending orders on behalf of particular cactus strategy instances										
	For now, only accepts orders for symbols the strategy is already registered for. Market data display will ultimately be added in a later release.										
											
NEW FEATURE: OnExternalOrder callback in the strategy interface											
	Can be used to intercept the orders being submitted by Strategy Manager (as well as 3rd party platforms)										
	Default implementation passes along the order for execution automatically. This can be overloaded for custom handling, and you can return false to NACK the orders										
											
ENHANCEMENT: Complete order history is available in StrategyManager by right clicking on an order in the Orders grid											
											
ENHANCEMENT: Strategy Manager now aggregates the Strategy Log grid											
											
ENHANCEMENT: Strategy Manager now has option "Export Strategy Logs" in the Data menu											
											
ENHANCEMENT: Positions grid allows for looking up positions as of a prior date/time																		
											
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7/19/2012: Version 1.0.0.0 Release Notes

BUG FIX: 	Fixed problem where after reuse of a backtest instance, RegisterForStrategyEvents and OnResetStrategyState were called in the wrong order			
				
NEW FEATURE: New StrategyCommands systesm to let developers DefineStrategyCommands (similarly to parameters) that will appear for triggering on the GUI				
	StrategyCommand(CactusUInt32 commandID,  const std::string& commandName, InputType inputType = INPUT_TYPE_NO_INPUT, const std::string& inputPrompt = "");			
	void ExampleStrategy::DefineStrategyCommands()			
	{			
		StrategyCommand command1(1, "Liquidate");		
		strategy_commands().AddCommand(command1);		
	}			
	void SimpleMomentum::OnStrategyCommand(const StrategyCommandEventMsg& msg){}			
	Commands  will be accessible in the Strategy Manager in the right click menu for an Instance or StrategyType			
				
NEW FEATURE: Added handling for market imbalance data for the exchange's price clearing auctions				
	virtual void OnImbalance(const ImbalanceEventMsg& msg);			
				
NEW FEATURE: Added handling for security status and short sale restriction alerts				
	virtual void OnInstrumentAlert(const InstrumentAlertEventMsg& msg);			
				
NEW FEATURE: Command line utility to interface with a running server. Provides an alternative to relying on the server process's command prompt or the Strategy Manager				
	Included in the server upgrade packages, under the 'utilities' subdirectory. 
	Allows working in 3 modes: opening a command prompt, supplying a single command via program arguments, or loading a commands file for batch processing			
				
ENHANCEMENT: Added a "reason" field to OrderUpdateEventMsg and Strategy Manager's Orders grid in order to display things like reject reasons				
				
ENHANCEMENT: Added position level day shares traded and day trading costs to the Position grid in Strategy Manager				
				
ENHANCEMENT: In Strategy Manager, added ability to expire old completed orders from the Orders grid on a configurable time threshold.				
	The setting is available in Tools > System Settings			
				
ENHANCEMENT: New example strategy in the SDK, SimpleMomentum				
	Demonstrates a portfolio strategy that goes long names whose short term moving average is above a longer term moving average, short otherwise			
	This strategy demonstrates usage of limit orders and StrategyCommands			
				
ENHANCEMENT: New command line commands for controlling strategies by type within a particular trading group				

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6/12/2012: Version 0.9.9.7 Release Notes

BUG FIX: 	Fixed sporadic problems that could occur with renegotiating sequence numbers between Server and Strategy Manager after a network disconnect									
										
BUG FIX:	Strategy Manager now properly detects when a backtest instance is re-used via the Server command prompt, and clears out the data for the prior run of the backtest									
										
BUG FIX:	Fixed an issue with properly restoring order state with ENABLE_RECOVERY mode for certain sequences of cancel/rejected  orders									
										
INTERFACE REVISION: Strategy projects must have a new function in the extern "C" section of their headers to identify the version of the SDK they were built with.										
	This allows the Server to reject loading old strategy dll's that are no longer compatble with it after a server upgrade. The SDK's example strategy projects have been updated to include:									
	    _STRATEGY_EXPORTS const char* GetReleaseVersion()									
	    {									
	        return Strategy::release_version();									
	    }									
	Also Cactus Server will now release its handle on the dll/so if it fails to match on version/user/group, so that the server can reload a corrected build without a restart									
										
NEW FEATURE: Strategy Manager has a new dialog in the Tools menu for managing the Server's default account fees and propogating new settings to already existing strategy instances.										
										
NEW FEATURE: Strategy Manager's Add Instance dialog's Params tab now provides the ability to create a batch of instances with a range of parameter values										
										
NEW FEATURE: To complement the SendMessageToStrategy, we've added Topic based pub/sub messaging to the Strategy API										
	Subscribe for topics via eventRegister->RegisterForTopicSubscription(...)									
	Send messages for a topic via runtime_event_register()->SendMessageToTopic()									
	Receive messages for a topic via the OnTopicMessage() event hook									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Usability improvements to Strategy Manager's Add Instance dialog, better autopopulation based on where it's initiated from the Strategy Tree										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Usability improvements to Strategy Manager's New Backtest dialog, better autopopulation based on Strategy Tree context, multi-select, start batches on multiple backtest servers at once										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Added mapping of some new liquidity codes in the Lime execution handlers, and also added some built in logic for avoiding incompatibilities in rout configuration flags and order types										
										
ENHANCEMENT: In LimeAdapter, added handling for Citrius's new onMulticastLoss alerts										
	Multicast Loss wil trigger an OnDataSubscription alert, with state = DATA_SUBSCRIPTION_WARNING, alert = DATA_SUBSCRIPTION_ALERT_DATA_GAP_DETECTED									
	Optionally, if the Multicast Loss occurs on an order book, a new server config file flag can instruct the Cactus Server to remove the exchange's book from the aggregate order book									
		This can be used to avoid having hanging orders affect the aggr_order_book, top_quote, and fill simulations, while still continuing to recieve data from the lossy feed in OnDepth and OnQuote:								
		LIME_ADAPTER_WITHDRAW_FROM_AGGR_OB_ON_MULTICAST_LOSS=true								
										
ENHANCEMENT: Refinements to FillSimulator invokations in Backtesting servers										
	 Prices on marketable fills are no longer delayed until the next tick, and Simulator fill processing is now rechecked after internally timed events									

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------							
5/10/2012: Version 0.9.9.5 Release Notes
							
BUG FIX: 	With Recovery Mode enabled, simulator now correctly cancels out open orders that were left over from before the server shut down						
							
BUG FIX:	Added fields for group membership to the Strategy Manager's Add User dialog, to allow correct initiatialization of a new user's group credentials from Strategy Manager						
							
NEW FEATURE: New server type ships with the SDK: CactusTrader Local Dev Server							
	This server allows for local testing of strategy dlls against a simulated order book (order book data generated by a random price process).						
		>Simulates data for multiple symbols and multiple exchanges but does not yet include simulating Consolidated Quote feeds. Over time we will make the test cases more flexible and realistic					
	This server requires no licensing and does not enforce user/group authership validation checks, the purpose is to allow easy debugging on a dev box before promoting a strategy to a server with licensed data						
							
ENHANCEMENT: Strategy Manager window will flash if an error level system message or strategy log arrives to make it more obvious something has gone wrong							
							
ENHANCEMENT: OneTick backtesting adapter updated to interface with the database tables in Lime's upcoming hosted OneTick offering, and to accept authentication parameters							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Added support for TickData.com's equity options trade files to the TickData.com backtest reader							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Added a dialog to the Strategy Manager for loading a file with a bulk list of strategy instance definitions, to help automate the process of creating strategy instances							
							
ENHANCEMENT: New server command prompt options for run/stop/pause by strategy type, update params by type, report an external fill, and load a file containing a bulk list of prompt commands							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Added BollingerBandIndicator to CactusAnalytics							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Upgrades boost to version 1.49							
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/10/2012: Version 0.9.9.2 Release Notes										
										
BUG FIX: Fixed problems in Linux server builds where server shutdown process can hang if there are open Strategy Manger connections.										
										
BUG FIX: Strategy Manager is now able to better handle if it stays up between server restarts where a Strategy type's parameter definitions have changed, and if it's										
	connected to multiple servers with inconsistent parameter definitions for the same strategy type due to strategy version mismatches.									
										
NEW FEATURE: Expanded server's command line control functionality, including starting, stopping, pausing strategies, and changing their parameters. 										
	See the GettingStarted guide for command line documentation									
										
INTERFACE REVISION: Changed OnOrderUpdate's event message from passing along the submitted order_params() to pass along the full order_details()										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Transitions trade condition handling to allow for up to four trade conditions. Moves trade condition summary functions from ConditionCodes.h to inside the Trade class.										
	In addition to adding trade_condition2, trade_condition3, and trade_condition4, we added bool HasSpecifiedtradeCondition(TradeCondition), 									
	which allows you to check for conditions without worrying about which field it should be in, and without having to worry about when your historical data									
	 transitioned from using single trade conditions to four.									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Scheduled events now have deterministic priority relative to time bars. If bars and scheduled events are due at the same time, bars will come first.										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Named constructor for RecurringScheduledEvents now takes an endFireTime parameter.										
										
ENHANCEMENT: More heartbeating between Strategy Manager and server so we can detect stalled TCP/IP connections more promptly										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Additional heartbeating in the server's event processor to prevent sparse after hours market activity from leading to lags in triggering timed events										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Updates SDK's copy of Eigen to version 3.0.5										
										
ENHANCEMENT: In Strategy Manager, added ability to hide columns from Positions/Orders/Executions/TradeReports grids										
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/6/2012: Version 0.9.9.0 Release Notes										
										
BUG FIX: Fixed problems with market state initialization for new strategy instances added post open if the server starts pre-open										
										
BUG FIX: Ensures event times are always set appropriately for StrategyControl event messages										
										
BUG FIX: In LimeExecutionAdapter, correctly handles missing fields in a few dark pool routes' (BIDS, VORTX) execution reports, corrects AllowRouting handling for EDGEX/EDGEA										
										
BUG FIX: SprywareAdapter wasn't normalizing source_time fields to UTC										
										
BUG FIX: StrategyManager doesn't receive StrategyType broadcast refresh after reloading strategy dlls.										
										
NEW FEATURE: Adds ability to import fills from external sources via the StrategyManager GUI, so live strategies can incorporate them into position management										
	The input dialog is located in StrategyManager's Tools->Manage External Fills; an example of the import file format is located in the SDK's docs directory.									
	The Strategy API exposes the imported fills via the new OnExternalFill event in the Strategy class.									
										
NEW FEATURE: VWAP indicator class in CactusAnalytics; tracks VWAP either over a time-based window or volume based window, and allows for filtering input trade sizes.										
										
ENHANCEMENT: In CactusAnalytics' InhomogenousOperator library, added two new variants of OperatorActivityPerSecond: OperatorDampedActivityPerSecond and OperatorAverageActivityPerSecond										
	The new variants offer alternative methods for smoothing the estimate, so that it's less influenced by small time intervals leading to spikes in the metric									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Adds ATSs (dark pools) to the market center id enum, and an IsEquityATS function to help classify them										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Adds new fields to the OrderParams: minimum_quantity, peg_type, peg_offset, is_hidden, post_only										
	Note in this release the Cactus Fill Simulator ignores these new fields, but an upcoming version will add peg order simulation capability									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Adds support for RouteInstructions and LockedCrossAction to LimeExecutionHandler's config file; removes the MidPeg flag as its been moved to the API										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Cactus server will no longer autoclose if connection to primary market data adapter fails.										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Executable names for the Cactus Servers are now differentiated by server type to make it easier to tell the processes apart when multiple flavors are running on the same box										
	New executable names are: CactusTraderBacktestServer.exe, CactusTraderLiveSimServer.exe, CactusTraderProdServer.exe									
										
ENHANCEMENT: Updates LimeAdapter to build against Citrius 2.1.7										
										
ENHANCEMENT: Adds handling for LAVA depth feed in the LimeAdapter										
	As LAVA is not an exchange, we build an order book for it, but it does not contribute to the Aggregate order book, as the liquidity is redundant with LAVA's quotes on NSX									
										
ENHANCEMENT: In LimeAdapter, adds option to attempt to auto-reconnect to Citrius datasources if login fails, useful when starting server before all lime source feeds are active										
	This can be enabled by setting LIME_ADAPTER_LOGIN_RECONNECT=true in the server's config file		
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
2/3/2012: Version 0.9.8.7 Release Notes							
							
BUG FIX: Empty string strategy parameters caused an error output on server console when server starts up							
							
NEW FEATURE: Strategy Manager now gives the option to filter out inactive times ranges from the performance graph.							
							
NEW FEATURE: Added the ability to configure servers from within the Strategy Manager GUI, and to see which instances belong to which servers in the Strategy tree							
							
NEW FEATURE: New backtest reader available for tickdata.com's flat files							
							
ENHANCEMENT: IOrderBook interface now has accessors for TotalBidSize and TotalAskSize							
							
ENHANCEMENT: New trade_actions->SendCancelAll(const Instrument*) overload for cancelling all orders for just a particular instrument							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Strategy Manager remembers more of its user settings between sessions							
							
ENHANCEMENT: Updated Spryware adapter to use the latest 3.2.1.32 version of their MIS api
